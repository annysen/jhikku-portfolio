        <p>
          Imagine there's no heaven. It's easy if you try. No hell below us.
          Above us, only sky. Imagine all the people livin' for today. Imagine
          there's no countries. It isn't hard to do Nothing to kill or die for
          And no religion, too. Imagine all the people Livin' life in peace. You
          You may say I'm a dreamer. But I'm not the only one. I hope someday
          you'll join us And the world will be as one.
